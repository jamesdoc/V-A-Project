# V&A API call app

Just a quick application to start to learn how to use Python.

Calls to the API with the following parameters:
- Material (-m)
- Name (-n)
- Place (-p)
- Before date (-b)
- After date (-a)
- Output (-o)

## Output
Output accepts either 'screen' or 'file'. Screen simply responds by outputting the HTML table to the console window. File follows up by asking for a file name. A new HTML file is then created.
